I hate that I fucked up the one good thing in life.,2
My constant negative state of mind and shitty personality is something that I have always hated about myself.,2
But I have grown to worry that these negative aspects of my life won‚Äôt ever go away.,2

I am always on the verge of crying.,2
I am always inside my head.,2
The world and the people are just big blur passing by.,0
Earlier I used to feel like I am always acting but now I don't even act anymore.,2
"I just sit in the class, in the mess, in my room looking down at the floor, inside my own head....just thinking....but I'm not even thinking anything anymore.",2
Not even bad thoughts.,0
It's just blank.,0
And people get so confused by me.,0

It just feels like I am unable to comprehend simplest of things anymore.,2
"Simple words, animals, countries.....simplest of things you learn in kindergarten....its gone..its all gone.",0
I don't even know how to explain it...no one understands and I don't want them to understand anymore.,2
It feels like I'm high all the time even though I don't even know how high feels like.,0
"Yesterday, I was all alone in my room (obviously) and I felt this dam breaking but instead of tearing up, I started laughing.",2
And I laughed for like half an hour.,0
I don't know what I was laughing at....maybe I was just laughing at myself...bitch wanted to be normal...look at me now.,1
"I don't even know what i am typing but since none of you will ever know me or even read this, no harm right?",1

I have unlocked a new level of depression.,2
Yay me!,0
"I don't really know how to call this, maybe is a rant maybe is a takeoff my chest, maybe i'm just being a crybaby... but i'm so tired, i have been like this for a long time now, somethimes is depressed, sometimes is just tired, of this shitty world of this shitty society of my bad choices, of my good choices that give me an excuse to live.",2
"I also have this feeling that says ""you do not belong here"" ",2
I know i'm capable of standing that (i have been standing it for the last 10 years of my life).,1
"A few months ago i finally found a girl that on sight made me forgot about everything, like a huge burden just got lifted.",0
"and everything worked so fine so perfectly... at least in 90% of everything, the other 10% i was sure we can fix it with time and patience... she made me laugh hard, made feel happy and really alive, best part was according to her it was the same i was the first men she actually wanted to marry, to have sons to share a life with.",0
we broke up... better said she broke up with me.,1
It hurts me harder than anything in my life (and i belive me when i say i have gotten into some really nasty falls and accidents ) i feel like i couldnt breath.,2
"In a desperate and stupid attemp to win her back: I cried, i ask a friend to please arrange a meeting, go to her home (only to return without talking to her because when i called her and she picked up i din't had the courage to tell her i was nearly at her front door) I broke all my rules for her, i even call her mother to see if she can intercede for me.",1

nothing more nothing less.,0
"she told she coulnd't she was busy, i still ask what day she wasn't busy ""all of tehm i'm busy"" was the answer... it was like everything started again, i even got fever... and now i'm here feeling worst than before, i would have been happy (or at least have a normal life) facing my old demons, but facing them and losing her it's killing me... don't know what more to ad... thanks for reading me.",2

"Recently I have tried over and over to quit self harm, go walking more, and just try to ""fake it till I make it"" by trying things that are ""supposed to make me happy"".",2
And for like a second they worked.,0
It was a glimmer of hope in what has been the dark black hole abyss that is my life.,2
"I felt something that wasnt completely terrible, but it went away overnight.",0
"And you might say that glimmer of happiness is a sign of a turning point, but it's not.",1
It basically served as a reminder of how fucked up I am and how I'll never feel good for a prolonged time ever.,2
"Okay, yeah that's a bit drastic, but fuck I almost wish i never felt it because everything has hurt so much more since.",2
I have been self harm clean for almost 2 weeks and I'm using some concoction that is supposed to make the scars go away but jeez.,1
I just want to cut to relieve some of this bitter loneliness and hatred of myself and people.,2
Without SH I've just been so much more irritable and angry and I feel awful for taking it out on people but i dont even know what is happening to make me feel this way to begin with.,2
And the urge to self harm is so incredibly strong I know I'll relapse within the next few days.,2
"I'm supposed to have this so called ""support system"" of friends, but they just blow me off at the drop of a hat.",2
It honestly kills me a little because I thought my friends would actually be there to help even just to talk and I know its asking a lot but I try not to overload them.,2
I drop literally everything for my friends.,0
"I cancel plans to go make sure they're okay, I miss things to help them with school, I spend the little money I have to get their favorite food and drinks if they're injured or sick.",0
I'm like a mom friend sometimes but w/e.,0
"I feel like I'm always nice and helpful and try to do as much as I can for my friends and when I'm stuck in a spiral or I want to die, I feel like I should be allowed to ask for some help.",2
"Like i hospital dont want to go to the because that fucking sucked, and I've been kicked out of every program I've been in, I just would like someone to show up for me like I have and would for them.",2
I feel like I've done something wrong to upset them with me or something's happened to make them think that I deserve this.,1
I have no idea why i get blown off or ignored.,1
"I mean, I could guess, but that's just my fucked up head saying things and itll make things worse.",2
I am just exhausted from being there for everyone and then being alone when the worst parts of my mind take over.,2
And I dont want sympathy for them I just would like to fucking have company so I dont do anything bad to myself that I know and they know is a real possibility and is probably going to happen if I'm left alone which I always am.,2
I know no one wants to be around me because I'm depressed.,2
"I'm no fun and I'm just boring and sad all the time, but I just need help and I've tried so hard to get better at reaching out, but it's all for not.",2
I just need to come to terms that no one will be there for me ever.,2
And I'm not trying to throw a pity party.,0
"I just am so completely frustrated and no one hears me, or they hear me but they dont listen to me.",2
I never feel heard and I feel like I'm just screaming I ok the void at this point.,2
Nothings going to come of this.,0
I'm just better off gone and forgotten I guess.,2
I'm just so tired.,2
I cant keep doing this.,1
I'm exhausted as soon as I wake up until I go to sleep.,2
I'm exhausted from breathing and I'm exhausted in my dreams.,2
I'm just worn down.,1
Anyways if you made it this far thanks for reading I guess.,0
I just needed to get this out of my head for a minute so I can try to get through tonight without cutting.,2
I can't get past the feeling that my friends and family would be completely fine without me.,2
I've cancelled all my plans that I have made with anyone and silenced all media apps.,1
I just need to be alone for a few days.,2
Anyone else get like this?,0
I hate this.,2
I just feel like I'm the most boring person ever.,2
But when I'm near people I'm all happy and funny.,0
But I know it's all faked.,2
Deep down I know I'm just nothing.,2
Nothing about me is interesting.,2
I have no fire to do anything.,2
I just dont care about doing anything.,2
And I know I should care.,0
That there should be at least one thing keeping me going.,1
But theres just nothing.,1
I'm terrified about meeting people.,2
I feel so trapped in my life and what I'm doing.,2
I just want to be normal.,2
I want people to talk to.,1
People who care about me.,0
Not just when I'm around or its convenient.,0
I know part of it is my fault.,0
I'm so bad at talking to people.,1
But I'm just boring.,2
I wouldn't want to talk to me either.,2
"I don't really have a reason to be depressed, I have a loving family (divorced parents but that seems like a norm these days) I have 2 close friends, which is better than none, I have a job, but nothing makes me happy and I'm honestly quite sad 24/7 I don't know how to talk to people, idk where I'll be in 5 years",2
"Hello, as title suggests I am kinda in that area again of depression.",2
Teachers are already giving up on me for not showing up at school when I am starting to feel better.,1
I am writing this in hopes that some of you can help me.,1
I can‚Äôt talk to anyone close because I fear that I will drain them.,2
"I just need help from someone, and at this point, I don‚Äôt mind internet strangers to help me.",2
So I've been super depressed for a while now (recently getting better on my own) and I feel uncomfortable telling most people because; 1: An extended family member attempted suicide and his family (including mine) treats and views him as some sort of baby made of glass who can't even walk up stairs without help.,2
The vast majority of my nuclear and extended family have alienated any sort of capability he has for anything and he can't stand it.,0
"They don't see him as a human being anymore, rather a constant *risk* of some kind.",1
I am deathly afraid of this happening to me.,1
"I don't really relate to my ""friends"".",1
"They're just people who don't fit anywhere else, like me.",2
"So we kinda just group together like societal leftovers or something, but now new groups are forming.",2
Groups that I *also* can't relate to.,0
So my interests are almost always shot down immediately.,1
"I opened up to these people about my struggle slightly out of desperation and they beraded me with insults and accusations of (paraphrase)""farming for pity"" and taking advantage of them like some sort of master manipulator.",2
Sometimes even just calling me names (although not everyone did).,2
"While they did this they kept telling me I needed help and that I *had* to listen to what they were saying or I'd ""end up dead"".",2
That's the set-up.,0
Recently they started a new group chat for one of the other guys in the group who was struggling with getting over a girl he perceived to be leading him on.,0
"Everyone flocked to him and congratulated him for being strong, but when I brought up that I was still struggling and said that I was horrified of being alienated by my family, they called me lazy, saying I ""wasn't taking initiative"" to talk to someone.",2
That made me feel extremely shitty and ashamed of why I'm feeling so depressed all the time; like what I'm going through means nothing and that I'm just lazy or useless.,2
"On top of this, I think I'm slowly figuring out why I've been so depressed for so long, which happens to do with my sexuality.",2
"Funnily enough a surprising fraction of my ""friend"" group is homophobic.",0
So that doesn't help.,0
My fears of speaking about my suffering became a self-fulfilling prophecy and I wonder.,1
Are friends supposed to be like that?,0
"They've always said they have my back but never actually do anything, and in fact, treat me like dirt or the bottom rung of a ladder.",2
"I just feel deeply depressed, ashamed, useless, weak, a hindrance, a waste and a detriment to everyone around me.",2
I'm lost and alone with no one around to trust and I can't do anything besides cry.,2
This is me crying for help.,2
I feel like I'm losing my mind and have no idea what anything truly is.,2
Sometimes even my own reflection scares me because I don't always immediately recognize it.,2
"I'm 18 btw and not just saying all this to be ""trendy"".",0
I just want this to go away and to be better already; it's so exhausting.,2
I'm not sure if I've even ever had a real relationship,1
Any one feel like they dont care anymore,1
"Hello again
I am back
Crying in my bathroom
I was talking to my family and I told them I don‚Äôt want a birthday because it would just be another thing to use against me.",2
" 
They want me to do work around the house and I told them a positive work environment that makes you not want to die makes a difference in how you perform.",2
My mom then told me that I over exaggerate because they dont do anything to hurt me.,1
I told them that they say some very hurtful things very often and her response was that if I listened to her then she wouldn‚Äôt have to go there.,1
"She wants me to earn her kindness, or not even, she wants me to earn her acting like a decent human towards someone.",1
"
Mind you i had eaten two samosas all day because my mom hadn‚Äôt cooked anything for us  and I was feeling dizzy.",0
Also I felt nauseous because theres maggots in her fucking pantry because she buys too many potatoes and then they go bad.,0
"I did what I could before i went to the bathroom to throw up but the only thing that came out was saliva cuz i havent eaten
",0
"They think I never do anything for anyone 
Meanwhile for people that dont make me want to die I help with their homework and almost did the dishes for one of them.",0
"
They really said that to me

",0
I have been in a bad place mentally since my ex cheated on me and left me.,2
We were together for 4 years and I got the ring (family heirloom) that I was going to give to her at her family's Christmas get together.,0
Every since she left me I feel like I can't trust anyone and that I'm not good enough or attractive enough for anyone.,2
"So I tend to just go to work and come home to my dog, who I got for my ex but she doesn't have the funds to care for a dog and herself.",0
I basically never go out and if I do it's mostly by myself because I don't really have any friends.,1
I moved to this town for work and to be with my ex so I never tried to make friends.,0
I am very nerdy and shy so that doesn't help meet people either.,0
I have asked 1 girl out since my ex left me and got rejected.,0
Honestly I'm not even sure what I am looking for by posting this.,0
Maybe I'm just looking to vent or I don't know.,0
Sorry for the book.,0
Edit: her and I broke up 9 months ago.,0
"I have stopped contacting her, but she still insists on trying to talk to me and be my friend.",0
I feel like this has easily been the worst year of my life and it is only half way done.,2
To start my step father had passed away on February 16th in a horrific car accident leaving my mother alone and confused with her three idiot sons.,1
"My friends father had killed himself and i felt so bad for him that i started to cut myself and hoping that this was rock bottom for us all, but then my boyfriend of 3 years breaks up with me confessing on how he was just using me for his own personal gain and i felt so empty inside and i look around and it seems that everyone else around has a better life than i do.",2
Bullies at school don‚Äôt help either and exams are starting to stress me out way too much.,2
Sometimes i dont even want to get out of bed and i have recently tried to take my own life and thankfully failed.,2
"If this is half of 2019 for me, then what does the rest of it have lined up for me?",0
"I feel like all my friends hate me currently and I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôve done
They‚Äôre all just suddenly ignoring me but one",2
I hate my life.,2
I feel lost and unhappy im stressed all the time.,2
"Constant fighting at home,  I have no friends or any where to go after work.",2
I dont drink and i don't want to.,0
Life sucks.,2
I get off work at 3 and ill go home and hide in the spare bed room becuase i have no where else to be.,1
My boss knows whats going on and he supports me the best he can but.,0
My therapist is on vacation till the 20th.,0
"I finally visited the doctor, after suffering 40h without sleep, and talked about my depression and suicide thoughts, I am getting my blood tested on monday and got prescribed some sleep meds and anti depressants.",2
My doctor acted professional and treated me like a human beeing and talked about all future options and assigned me to a psychiatrist.,0
"I talked to my mother, wich went better than expected.",0
My friend is unhappy with me taking anti depressants but he accepts it.,0
"Life is starting to go up again, I found hope again

Thanks for reading<3   
(Sorry for bad english)",0
I've never felt so depressed than I do now.,2
I've faced it before many years ago and thought I beat it on my own.,0
The bad days got farther apart over time.,1
But I never really cured myself of it.,0
"It's been there all along, just under the surface and the dam is starting to break.",0
It has been for a year.,0
The hobbies which distracted me no longer distract.,2
The lies I've told myself no longer convince.,2
The mask is starting to deteriorate.,2
"And the saddest part, I know what I must do to make things better but that path seems deeper than that seemingly bottomless layer of depression.",2
"Embarrassment, instability, consequences, all boost my fear.",2
It paralyzes me from digging deep and walking that path.,2
It tells me there is no going back and I can't make it.,2
"If I don't make it, I will be consumed by the depression and stuck forever.",2
I wish I knew the secret.,0
A way to ignite that spark and plow forward instead of being dragged till I stand up or give up.,1
"1st things 1st, I'm ok with my life and its not swirling into a wormhole of sadness.",0
"I'm just having this huge sudden realization that we are in a constant circle of greed, gluttony, and wraith.",2
"As a species we are failing to unite, we hold or selves back in technology because we are afraid of change.",0
We constantly wage war on one another for selfish and childish reasons.,0
Everyone is always trying to be better than the man standing beside them and we are going to get no where like this.,1
"I yearn for a world of bliss, one with meaning, or one with something actually worthy of fighting over.",1
I mean we have a whole universe in front of us and we seem to always blindside it and revert to fighting among our selves.,1
It's getting to the point where nothing but these thoughts fill my mind as i walk the streets or think at night.,0
I feel like was born in the wrong universe at the wrong time... Alone and with no one or nothing to relate to.,2
"Feels like i'm going insane, like i just want it to end.",2
Every time i close my eyes and fall to sleep i hope that i do not awake in this world filled with fools.,2
I mean the way that our structure is right now is pathetic... You can't even get any where in life if you dont play the game.,1
"The game is pretty much like this you are thrown into a world where unless you follow the steps that everyone follows (School, Work, Bills, Ext.).",0
"Then you will utterly be forced into a life of sadness and despair, But if you play the game then only the people sitting on top of the ladder are actually benefiting and having a somewhat good life.",1
Those stuck at the bottom are pretty much stranded there due to the broken society that has been formed.,1
I just wish i could go to a uninhabited island and start anew or create a world of my own.,2
Other than that i have no hope for this planet or anything on it...,2
"I hate it, i feel like my true potential will never be unleashed and i'm just another pawn to this FUCKING STUPID chess game.",2
P.S.,0
"- I know this may seem far fetched, but i just have no other way to get these thoughts off my chest without people wanting to put me on the 3rd floor.",0
As a 9 year old I was massively depressed and tried to kill my self in the subsequent year to come.,2
I was heavily bullied and degraded by family.,2
Suffered sexual abuse when I was 4-9 years and raped at 15.,2
My mother was abusive and beat me up for small things and so did my step dad.,2
My boyfriend at 17 was also quite abusive and I ended the relationship when I was 23.,2
For the longest time I've felt older than my age.,0
I'm 27 now and married.,0
Moved out of my mother's home and finishing my degree.,0
I still feel really depressed at times and feel like I'm a 50 year old.,2
I don't find joy and happiness in anything and I feel so alone even when I have a circle of great friends.,2
I guess I wanna know is when should I really off myself.,2
Should I give it one more year or just end the suffering.,2
Things never seem to get better and I constantly feel like I'm in the back seat just watching my robotic body do things and interact.,2
Edit: thank you all.,0
I still feel suicidal but I appreciate you all going out of your way to reply to me.,2
Hello.,0
It feels a bit awkward because I'd have never in my life imagined that I'd be writing here.,0
"Lately, I've been very, very depressed.",2
Even worse than I used to be.,1
I'm struggling whether to leave or stay with my bf.,1
"He didn't do anything wrong, he loves me and takes care of me, and he's really the ideal partner.",0
"The thing is that I no longer have feelings for him, not in a romantical way.",0
"I love him as my best friend, not bf.",0
That's why I have terrible anxiety.,2
"I've never experienced breakup since this is my first relationship, which lasts for 3 years.",0
"I can't decide what to do: whether to breakup and lose him, and with him also his family and friends, that I'm very close with.",0
"Or I can stay, but deep inside I will always know that there is someone, somewhere, who I could love the way I want to love someone.",0
"I want to try something new, with someone new, but I can't imagine losing my best friend(=actual bf).",0
"Sometimes, I Just feel like it would be all easier to just end it up.",1
None of this would hurt anymore.,1
No choices.,0
"The only thing I've been doing these days is crying, mental-breakingdown and discussing whether it's all worth it.",2
What's better?,0
"Breaking two hearts by leaving, or only one, the mine, by staying?",1
Help me.,2
last Saturday i survived my suicide attempt.,2
now my parents know how i feel i hate it.,2
i dont want to see a therapist i dont want to do anything.,2
the antidepressants arent working.,0
just let me rot.,2
i wish everything would stop because its so nauseating having to move and do anything im tired.,2
its not like im going to kill myself yet.,2
but i really regret putting this on them.,1
"ive made things worse, with my dads cancer this just adds more.",1
i really am just pathetic.,2
I'm just ignored at my house just like I'm not there.,2
"My dad has forgotten me on road trips and had to turn around and get me, my mom has forgotten to give me a plate when it's time to eat and I've had to remind her.",1
"I've done alot to get noticed like excel in band, culinary, and school in general but so I get is a good job.",0
While my brothers get all the attention my big brother went to my birthday party and made it all about him while me and my friends did whatever and my little brother gets all the attention and whatever he wants I basically am Lisa Simpson but in real life.,0
My mom says it because I'm the easy kid but it still hurts to be forgotten.,2
"So, this is my first post here.",0
This is going to be long and  I don't even know if any of you is going to actually read my post but I need to say this to someone.,0
"So, here goes...",0
I have been depressed for years now.,2
There have been ups and downs.,0
I have always been kinda ashamed of it because I didn't want to be perceived weak.,2
I blew up my friendships because of it.,1
I became a loner at my college and I just wanted it to be over.,2
I finally told my parents and they were supportive- they got me medications for it.,0
And for a moment I felt free of the burden.,0
"I worked hard for myself for next two months and after college, I got myself into this great institute for further business studies.",0
Now....,0
"I don't know what my parents thought my depression was but suddenly they were like ""You're into a great institute now.",0
"Good place, better people- *We don't think you need any reasons to be depressed now*.""",0
"I thought, yes,  its not okay to be totally depended on my medications and the only way I can get out of this is to maybe start all over again.",0
"It's never too late, right?",0
So I decided that I will be this totally different person now.,0
I will meet new people and I will not make same mistakes to isolate myself again.,0
"But the thing is, even if you are in a new place and you're trying to be this new (more real) version of yourself, your past still catches up to you.",0
I had wasted last 6 years being depressed and being in bed all day.,2
Too insecure to try anything.,2
And those 6 years aren't going to just vanish.,0
These things had consequences.,0
Now I am here in this great place but I am the dumbest person here.,1
I have no skills.,2
No interest.,2
Nothing in my resume.,0
I try to be better but its like my brain doesn't process information anymore.,2
I can't even explain it to anyone.,1
It's like my brain functions are deteriorating.,2
It scares the hell out of me.,1
And its so suffocating in this competitive environment that I sometimes question why did they even selected me in the interview.,2
But I still try to be positive.,0
"It's okay, right?",0
There's no need to live in my past.,0
I will work with whatever I have and make the best out of it.,0
*But your professional life is not everything.,0
You need a personal life.,0
"
I have zero social skills because in the last few years, I had totally given up on interacting with people.",1
I am ugly and i am insecure about it.,2
But I have grown out of it a little now.,0
"I still know I am ugly, but I have stopped being insecure about it.",0
And I had decided that I will talk to people here.,0
This is my second chance and I will not let my insecurities get the best of me.,0
So I put myself out there.,0
"Whenever I am outside my dorm, I try to interact with someone.",0
"To have a casual conversation, maybe I will find some similarity, maybe this will turn into a friendship?",0
But it's not working.,0
It's not working at all.,0
I swear I am trying my best here to not lock myself in my room again.,1
But people are not giving me any chance.,1
"No matter how helpful I am, how kind I am, how sincere I am, people never seem to have interest in me.",2
"Rather, they ignore me.",1
They literally ignore what I am saying.,1
"And not in ""she's being desperately clingy"" kind of way, I would have accepted that.",0
They ignore me like I am not there in the room.,1
They do not show any sign that they hear what I say.,1
They don't react to me at all.,1
"Not even a nod or a ""hmm"".",0
"And this goes for everyone- casual encounters, the ""hi"" I give to people passing by, my classmates, my project group- EVERYONE.",0
I even thought that maybe I am speaking too low.,0
I actively  tried being loud and clear-No Change.,0
"When we are standing in groups, no one makes eye contact with me.",1
Not even once.,0
It's like I'm invisible.,2
And it hurts so bad.,2
I had the worst time of my life last year.,2
I did things to myself that I am not proud of.,1
"And now that I am trying so hard to get out of this, to be positive, it's not working.",2
My parents think that I am the one who is isolating myself again.,2
They ask me why am I not making any friends.,0
How do I tell them that I am trying my best here.,0
"I want to get better too, you know.",0
But how do I make friends in such an environment where no one is ready to even acknowledge my presence.,1
What is so wrong with me?,2
What?,0
Is it because I am ugly or fat?,2
Or maybe because I can't be as funny as others?,1
Maybe it's because I do not bring anything new to the table?,1
What's so wrong with me?,2
I don't want to be alone here.,1
I am so scared that I am going to fall in the same hole again.,2
PS- Sorry for the bad grammar.,0
And a for writing such an incoherent mess.,0
I just needed to let it out.,1
"To say it to someone, even if it's a bunch of strangers.",0
Sooo..,0
I deserve to die.,2
And I‚Äôve deserved to die for a very very long time.,2
"I‚Äôve deserved far more pain and hurt than I‚Äôve gotten in my sad life, I‚Äôve deserved so many unpleasant things, and I know this.",2
But sometimes I forget.,0
And the fucken human brain is incredibly fucked.,0
I‚Äôve known my place in the world for a very long time and for some godamn reason I still forget and that makes remembering so much worse.,2
I can punish myself all I want and it never helps in the long run.,2
All it does is make a bunch of strangers lie and tell me ‚Äòhow much they care‚Äô.,2
It makes people pity me.,1
And that makes me want to die more and then I punish myself more and the whole cycle is so incredibly tiring.,2
"And I want it to stop, I want to be happy, but that will never happen and so I rant about it and complain to random people on reddit about how sad my life is.",2
I can‚Äôt even do anything about it.,1
I‚Äôm too busy  drowning in self pity to be useful.,2
And I‚Äôm just so tired,1
So I got a cat about 2 weeks ago well it will be 2 weeks tomorrow ,0
Even if that someone is a cat,0
I keep repeating the same mistake and can‚Äôt seem to get over them.,1
It‚Äôs a vicious cycle and I can‚Äôt get over it.,1
Need to learn how to forget and move on.,2
"As of the other day all my friends have ghosted or deleted me
Everything sucks
I feel so alone and nothing I can do will fix it because I can‚Äôt do anything",2
Edit/update:So I talked to her.,0
I told her I wanted to cut contact.,0
It's really upsetting her but if she's not sure what she wants what should I do?,1
If seems like she's gonna come back when things are more stable.,0
I could just move on.,0
it's my heart that's telling me not too,0
"

We were together for 7 fucking years man.",0
Like she's all I know.,0
I'm 22 now.,0
It's not about just finding a new woman and moving on.,0
It's not about that at all.,0
She keeps saying she wants me in her life ...,0
But she's now 100Km away and we're losing our apartment in 6 days.,0
I have nowhere to go.,1
I have no idea what the fuck to do.,1
"

I said this to her

",0
"But,

I get used to it.",0
Cause I don't feel like you'll ever come back now.,0
I'm so tired and exhausted I just wanna die for real.,2
I'm so sick of all the shit.,2
Im tired of trying when you don't even wanna be with me anymore.,1
You want your space and shit.,0
So like fuck it I guess that means everything we had was for nothing.,1
Because you don't understand what wanting to change means.,0
You don't seem to wanna believe me and if sucks.,0
I don't know what else to say I wanted to be together but you don't want me right now.,0
I shouldn't have to wait.,0
I'm in the middle of the toughest situation my life has ever thrown at me.,2
I lost my home Twice now because of my own stupidity ,2
Like fuck I lost everything.,2
My dreams hopes and wishes are all gone.,2
I don't wanna be anything I don't wanna do anything.,2
I'm just a loser ..,2
I give up I really fucking do.,2
"And what bothers me the most is you'll say some shit like ""okay"" you don't even reply with Any meaning it's all a pile of bullshit.",1
Im so exhausted So what should I do?,2
Any ideas.,0
I need someones help.,1
Or someone to talk to.,1
"Fuck my life

 girlfriend of 7 years cheated on me last year twice I forgave her now she left me and is 100km away says she still loves me but doesn't know what she wants losing my apartment and very depressed",2
I'd just be a lot happier if everyone else suddenly vanished.,2
"
just me and slow growing plants that will take over everything eventually.",0
but let's be honest that's just not possible and I kinda like the few people I've managed to call friends over the years.,0
does anyone else feel this way?,0
"self harm
I am truly and deeply sad, depression is taking over me almost entirely, I really have been feeling suicidal lately, I don't want to, but it feels like I'd end up doing it somewhere around the ongoing year :( I feel very very hopeless",2
"my mind is always bringing up negative thoughts and i always can't help but imagine on circumstances in which I commit suicide or how the people around me would react to my death or if i changed my appearance to what I aim for (handsome, intelligent, socially attractive,and more good things that an attractive person has).",2
"i am always so fucking bored, youtube doesn't entertain me as much as before so I stopped and social media is full of people posting about how fucking great their life is and here I am just overthinking things and imagining shit that makes me more depressed.",2
i dont wanna open up to my family or someone close to me because I don't think they are gonna care and they'll only think of it as a minor problem.,2
i really want to die rn but i really hate pain.,2
"i just want to sleep and never wake up again(srsly, is there a method to successfully do this?",2
From there i stopped texting to her nearly entirely..i did't want this to end.It was inevitable.,0
"I (28M) haven't been in a stable, long-term in my whole life...and it's starting to get to me.",0
"I've been in four relationships in the past 3 years, and for three of them, the other person picks someone/something over me, and the fourth there wasn't enough chemistry to make me like them enough to stay...even though I really tried to make myself like them.",0
"Two relationships with someone I was in love with, the other two I liked, but not loved.",0
The first girl was my best friend.,0
We did everything together.,0
"I made my feelings clear, but she didn't reciprocate.",0
"There was one moment, for a second I was 100% sure that had changed, but she denied any romantic feelings.",0
The second girl was my sister's best friend.,0
We had a lot in common.,0
"She was funny, intelligent, fun to be around...but there was something there that wouldn't quite let me connect on an emotional level, even though I REALLY wanted to like her.",0
The third girl was a friend of mine.,0
"We started hanging out more and more, flirts were exchanged...and just when I was sure we we're gonna seal the deal and start dating, she dumps me to return to her emotionally abusive exboyfriend.",0
The fourth girl I met back up with after being separated for about 5 years.,0
When I knew her she was absolutely perfect.,0
"Beautiful, caring, strong, brave, everything I wished I could be.",0
"When we met back up, I found that she liked me the whole time.",0
"Lucky me, right?",0
"Well, we started dating, and it didn't take long for me to realize that something was off.",0
"I stayed with her for 3 months, before I broke it off with her, finding her to be the singular source of all my stress and anxiety.",2
"After some reflection and distance, I realized that she was dumping all her emotional baggage that she'd accumulated over our separated 5 years on me, and that put a pressure on me that I couldn't handle.",1
"After some more reflection, I realized that the person I dated and the person I knew we're (emotionally) completely different people.",0
Haven't dated anyone since.,0
It's been about 18 months...and I'm in a new city for school.,0
"My life is together pretty good, but my heart aches to love someone, but I haven't had any opportunity.",0
I have so much to give...but nobody seems to see it...nobody seems to see me.,2
"I don't honestly expect anybody to have the magical answer to my problems, and I'm really not doing this for karma or anything, I just needed to vent this out.",0
